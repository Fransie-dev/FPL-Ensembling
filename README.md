# FPL-Ensembling


## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for my mini-dissertation project, which is completed in partial fulfilment for the degree of Master of Industrial Engineering under the supervision of Dr. Thorsten Schmidt-Dumont. The aim of this mini-dissertation is to investigate the applicability of machine learning and optimisation techniques to suggest player transfers for a manager in the Fantasy Premier League.

## Project Goals

* Implement variants of five distinctly functioning machine learning models 
* Implement a stacked ensemble of said models in an attempt to adjust for errors
* Define and solve the team formulation problem as a linear programming problem subject to team, position, transfer and cost constraints 
* Investigate the effect of chips on a team's point accumulation capacity
* Investigate how well the best performing model could have done in the 2020/21 Fantasy Premier League season

(This will be updated as soon as the project is finished)
