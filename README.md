# FPL-Ensembling


## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for my mini-dissertation project, which is completed in partial fulfilment for the degree of Master of Industrial Engineering under the supervision of Dr. Thorsten Schmidt-Dumont. The aim of this mini-dissertation is to investigate the applicability of machine learning and optimisation techniques to suggest player transfers for a manager in the Fantasy Premier League.

## Project Goals

* Use a stacked ensemble of five machine learning models to forecast player points
* Use a linear programming technique to construct a suggested team
* Evaluate how well the system would have done in the 2020/21 season
